# natural_units

The [Natural Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) convention file for [GNU units](https://www.gnu.org/software/units/).

## TL;DR

### Debian/Ubuntu

```console
$ apt-get install units

$ units -V   # check that you are running **GNU Units**, not BSD units.

GNU Units version 2.1x
with readline, with utf8, locale en_US
Units data file is '/usr/share/units/definitions.units'

$ units -f natural.units

113 units, 42 prefixes, 0 nonlinear units
You have: 1m
You want: s
    1m = 3.335641e-09 s
    1m = (1 / 2.9979246e+08) s
```

### macOS + Homebrew

```console
$ brew install gnu-units

$ gunits -V   # double-check that you are running **GNU Units**, not BSD units.

GNU Units version 2.1x

$ gunits -vf natural.units

113 units, 42 prefixes, 0 nonlinear units

You have: 1 / fm
You want: GeV
    1 / fm = 0.19732696 GeV
    1 / fm = (1 / 5.0677312) GeV
```

## Overview

`natural.units` is a definition file of the [natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) for [GNU units](https://www.gnu.org/software/units/).

***This is only for GNU units, not for BSD units pre-installed in macOS.***
You can check version by `units -v` (for BSD units) or `units -V` (for GNU units).

### Definition

In the natural units, all the units are given in terms of energy (giga electron volt, GeV) with defining
  **c = &hbar; = k<sub>B</sub> = 1**,
where c, &hbar; and k<sub>B</sub> are respectively the speed of light, the Planck constant and the Boltzmann constant.

For electromagnetism, we use the Lorentz-Heaviside convention, where the vacuum permittivity, &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>, and the vacuum permeability, &mu;<sub>0</sub>, are defined by
  **&mu;<sub>0</sub> = c<sup>2</sup>/&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> = 1**.
The fine structure constant is given by
  **&alpha; = e^2/4&pi;**,
where the elementary charge is given by
  **e = 1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C = 0.303**.

## How to use

  1. Install GNU units.
  2. Prepare the file `natural.units`.
  3. Run and convert!

### Installation of GNU units

You can install **GNU** Units with `apt-get` (Debian/Ubuntu) or via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (macOS) by

```console
apt-get install units   # Debian / Ubuntu
brew install gnu-units  # macOS
```

You should check that you are running **GNU** units, not **BSD** units (pre-installed in macOS), by

```console
$ units -V   # Debian / Ubuntu + apt-get
$ gunits -V  # macOS + Homebrew

GNU Units version 2.1x
```

### Run with `natural.units`

Run GNU Units with the file `natural.units`, downloaded from this GitHub repository:

```console
units -f natural.units    # Debian / Ubuntu + apt-get
gunits -f natural.units   # macOS + Homebrew
```


### Troubleshooting

You will encounter error message below if you are running *BSD* Units:

```output
units: redefinition of unit '#' on line 2 ignored
units: redefinition of unit '#' on line 3 ignored
units: redefinition of unit '#' on line 3 ignored
units: unexpected end of unit on line 3
units: redefinition of unit '#' on line 4 ignored
...
```

In this case, you have to recheck that you have installed **GNU** units and that you are using the correct command.

## Data Source and Convention

Values are taken from [PDG Review of Particle Physics 2014](http://inspirehep.net/record/1315584).

Planck mass is symbolized by `M_pl`, while reduced Planck mass is by `M`.

Light year (`ly`) is defined as
  **c &times; 365.25day**
following [NIST publication 811](https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811), while `yr` denotes `tropicalyear` as is in PDG table.
